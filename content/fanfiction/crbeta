Second structure demolished. I was concerned that I would need better tools, when the building was down to the foundation, but so far none of the buildings I've seen even had foundations. Team Terror apparently had the Patias region under their thumb, but they couldn't attract the funding to hire construction teams that actually knew how to do their job. At least it makes my job easier.


No noteworthy Pokemon encounters, today. The Repel is working just fine. No other noteworthy events.

Might as well continue writing in this log, I guess. The Lab apparently takes its commitment to detailed records seriously. I can't delete anything I've written before, and I can't edit out all the stuff that's probably going to get me fired. The only saving grace is that it's apparently also policy for Professors to ignore any logs that are dumped in the "Personal" folder, for researcher privacy. So, as long as I never give them a reason to investigate me, and so long as it doesn't turn out my Professor is the kind of academic who paws through her juniors' data, just because she has access, they should hand all the evidence of my wrongdoing to me at the end of my job, sight unseen, and I can toss it into nearest volcano.


And if either of those nightmare scenarios turn out to be true? Well, either I'm screwed or I'm not. Simple as that.


Speaking of screwed, I haven't seen Subject Alpha since the incident. It's been a few days, and I was genuinely terrified I was going to be seeing her at the edge of my vision, for at least as long as it took for her to ride out the rest of her heat. Based on what research I've done, we should be in the clear, now. Perhaps she just decided to tough it out. Or maybe she actually found somebody to crawl on top of who could produce viable Eggs for her. If it's the latter, I very much don't envy whatever poor creature has to deal with her bouncing on his lap.

I still play that scene in my head. A wild Pokemon attacked me in my cave. She could have stolen my food, or mauled me, but instead she decided to mount me. Like I was some kind of marital aid. She'd been after me, for days, if her behavior beforehand was any indication. Did she recognize we were incompatible, that I couldn't possibly give her an Egg? Was that why she did it? I wouldn't have thought it was a thing that a Pokemon would think of. I guess it wouldn't be surprising? I know the opinion of a lot of League trainers is to treat Pokemon like something between animals and military equipment, but the Lab has entire libraries dedicated to the subject of Pokemon intelligence. It can't be that far of a stretch to think that one of them, aware of Egg types, decided to try and avoid breeding while dealing with their hormonal urges.


And while I'm writing absolutely damning nonsense that nobody had better read, I'd like to formally announce my next thesis paper: Unorthodox Prophylactic Methods Among Follicular Pokemon. Won't that be a nice fireside read?


I need to take my mind off it. I'm going to be more careful, more vigilant. If she shows up again, I'll be ready for her with whatever I'll have to hand. In the meantime, I just wanna break something. I've gotten all the practice I need, taking down those two sheds or outhouses or whatever, but now it's time to set my sights high.


The central compound was the spot where Team Terror had been launching most of their plans against the Patias region. There's an absolute eyesore of a building right smack dab in the middle, and it's just begging for somebody to come down there with a hammer and do all the damage the Champion's Tyranitar couldn't do, the first time around. It's a bit of a hike, but I've been working out for the past few weeks. So, that building had better prepare its wooden body, because I'm coming for it.

I had made plans to travel to the large central compound, today, in order to clear away the structure. However, I met with unusual resistance. As I was taking one of the trails down the valley that would lead me to the headquarters, I saw something in the middle of the road.


It was a Pokemon. White fur, quadrupedal, with wide, sharp clawed paws and piercing red eyes. An Absol. The subject sat in the middle of the road, pointed squarely in my direction. It stared at me as though it were waiting for me to arrive. I kept my distance from it, naturally. Even loaded down with Repel I know better than to approach a wild Pokemon. Instead, I stood there, as confident as I was able to project, as though I belonged there as surely as any predator. The Absol did not appear threatened, but its attitude suggested that it was not going to move.


So, I decided to turn around. There were several routes to where I needed to go, and it would be nothing but lost time to try and go around the Absol. At least, that was what I thought. But when I went down the new path, it was there, too. The same Absol. I'm not sure how I'm so confident about that statement, but... I'm positive it was the same Absol blocking the way forward, on this new trail. So I went further around. I used an almost impassible little game trail, barely large enough to handle a migration of Ratata, and sure enough the creature was there. Sitting. Staring directly at me.


Obviously, I had to abandon my idea. Attempting to approach the compound would apparently also mean approaching a wild Pokemon, which was a risk I was not being paid to take. The encounter was confusing, more than anything else. Not that I'm surprised that a Pokemon could outpace me and be ready to block my travels, but that it was apparently perfectly able to predict where I was coming in from, and when I would be there. The only reason I have to suspect they might be different Absol is the fact that such foresight seems improbable. But... I don't think they are different. That glint in the eyes.


I had to set my sights somewhere less ambitious, today. Tomorrow I'm going to take stock of my position, while I do my observation duties. Maybe the road will be clear, the next time around. Who knows?

Encountered a wild Absol while en route to the former Team Terror headquarter building. Subject has been encountered before (see my last official report, where it was designated "Subject Beta"), when it blocked the way to the location. Today, it was there again, and this time it was hostile. Whereas before it merely sat in the middle of the road, today it was on its feet, growling and making aggressive gestures. Once it approached, past the range of the Repel, I immediately activated my whistler. Subject Beta responded to the device's high-pitched keening, and seemed to retreat momentarily, but then it suddenly attacked.


SB performed a maneuver, which I believe to be the technique "Night Slash" due to the dark purple coloration on its talons as it tried to strike me. Such a move is only used by advanced Pokemon. The damage it caused to the tree, I was standing near, bore that out more than supposition ever could. Fortunately, SB missed, only managing to cut the sleeve of my shirt and leave a superficial scratch on my arm. It also did not pursue, when I fled the scene. I immediately retreated to an open space, confirmed I was alone, and deactivated my whistler, before sneaking back to my cave.


As per protocol, I am sheltering in place for the remainder of the day, but I am confident that I was not followed. SB appears to be dead-set on keeping me away from the area, for whatever reason, and is apparently violent. Please advise.

Junior Researcher Larch,


I have received your incident report. You observed proper protocol by reporting and sheltering in place. As you certainly must be aware of, by now, that valley is home to some rather dangerous specimens. That a Pokemon was willing to attack, even through multiple layers of deterrents, suggests a level of determined resistance that is frankly troublesome.


Larch, I will be blunt. Giving you a partner Pokemon would be the safest option available to us. However, doing so would invalidate data collection efforts in the region, and so it goes against the charter of what you were sent out to accomplish. With that being said, my options are either to pull you out, or to equip you further. I've decided to do the latter.


The Item System should have a fresh set of supplies. Included in the package are a set of goggles. I trust you recognize the Silph Scanner. With it, you should be able to receive real time data on any Pokemon you see, including when they are using their techniques and (most importantly) where those techniques will land. It's a banned item in the League circuit, at least for trainers, but I've pulled some strings to have it recognized as a valuable safety device, for unpartnered workers like yourself. It comes with documentation, instructions on how to use it. Be sure to calibrate it during your observation duties, tomorrow.


As for this Absol, Subject Beta, as you refer to it: do not engage. I did not send you out there to fight territorial Pokemon. If it is keeping you from accessing the central compound, then stay away from the compound, for a while. Perhaps it is engaged in nesting behaviors, and can't be disturbed, in which case it will move away on its own. If not, we'll discuss next steps between the Lab and the Rangers. In the meantime, focus on what you can accomplish, safely.


Please acknowledge this message as soon as possible.

Professor Redwood

I honestly feel a little stymied. This is the second time a Pokemon has shown up that ignored Repel. At least this one only wanted to maul me. At least, I assume it only wanted to maul me. Who knows what these stronger Pokemon are thinking, half the time.


Today was an observation day, and half of my time was spent fiddling with the Scanner, trying to get it to work. I thought I'd lucked out, when a pair of Luxio burst into the clearing in front of my blind and started battling each other. I managed to get a good look at how the goggles indicate attacks being used, as well as its predictive arcs for the felines' pounces and electrical discharges. The only thing that I wasn't able to get a look at was the Scanner's threat avoidance interface, since none of those attacks were in any danger of hitting me.


Also, I only got a minute or two of experience, before one of them landed on the other's back and they started mating. I think it may have been the same pair of lovebirds I recorded during my first few days, in this forest. Apparently, this is just a thing they do, fight each other as foreplay. The Scanner wasn't very helpful, after that, though it was happy to point out exactly where the two of them were. It struggled to outline the male, as his hips worked frantically on top of the female's. I watched them go at it for a bit longer. Not because I wanted to, of course, but because their battling had scared away anything else that might have merited observation.


I'm not fooling myself, by saying that, but what the heck else am I supposed to say? That I'm jealous of a pair of cats and their shameless relationship? The only time I've gotten laid since college was when Subject Alpha c

Fuck this. I need to break something. I was looking at the map of the compound. There's an old back route, right along the bottom of the cliff wall. If I recall, the Champion used it to try and bypass the worst of Team Terror, when he launched his famous raid on the group. Subject Beta appears to be patrolling the area around the front of the place, but if I'm willing to take a bit of a hike I should be able to sneak past it. I don't know what that Absol's deal is, but if I can't fight it, I can go around it. I'm done letting this place scare me, get inside my head.

If there's one silver lining to all the things that happened to me, today, it would be that I now finally understand how Subject Beta kept being able to find me.


The back route wasn't as safe as I had initially thought. Even though I was as far away from the territory where I had consistently run into him, Subject Beta was waiting for me, again. He seemed annoyed, as frustrated to be having to stand there as I was, having him block my path again. I only had a moment to see that, however (and in truth, I might only be imagining that look). He was off like a shot, rushing for me with sudden speed. I didn't even have time to reach for the whistler on my belt, before the Absol's claws ripped it off of my body, along with a distressingly large chunk of denim. He didn't touch skin, but I found myself having to hold my pants up, even as I watched Subject Beta take my whistler in his mouth and hurl it against a nearby tree.


We stared at each other, a moment. I reached for the button on the side of my goggles. The Absol's body was lined in white, as data began to pour in. He attacked again. A red flash told me to step left, so I did. A second attack came, but this time there was no flash. In a panic, I backpedaled as Subject Beta swiped against the empty air in front of me. Then he did it again. And again. Even though I was struggling to back away from him, even though I was dodging blows while trying to keep my pants around my waist, none of his attacks hit. Only one or two of them even registered as being a threat. The rest of them, at least according to the Scanner, were aimed at places like the ground, or the air slightly to the right of me, or a nearby tree. After about two minutes of this, something was becoming painfully clear:


Subject Beta wasn't trying to hit me.


There was a moment's pause, in his onslaught. We both stood there a minute, breathing heavily (I admit, I might have been breathing a bit more heavily than him). It was then that I said what I realized, out loud. The Absol raised his head, eyes widening, which was how I knew that I had gotten it in one. Obviously, I'm confused. I ask him why he was trying so hard to convince me, otherwise. He didn't really have a response. I asked him why he keeps putting himself in my way. He responded with a warbling cry. It was around this point that I remembered that he was a Pokemon, and therefore couldn't speak in anything other than animal noises.


I'll admit, my guard was down. I was more confused, at this point, than I was scared. By Mew, I was more pissed off than I was scared. I was still holding my pants up, with one hand, while I went to go grab the whistler from where Subject Beta had thrown it. It was in pieces, naturally, which meant I would probably need to go straight back to the cave. The compound was nearby. As in, one more hill and I would have been able to see it in all its tetanus-inducing glory. Instead of doing that, however, I was going to have to waddle back home and write the entire day off as a loss. So, perhaps I wasn't thinking clearly, when I decided to get back on the road and climb up the hill towards the compound.


In a flash, Subject Beta was in front of me, again, head down and eyes set in a glare. I paused, of course, as one would naturally do when something barrels past your side. However, we stood there a minute, and neither of us moved. Eventually I spoke.


"What's past this hill?" I asked (or, words to that effect, at least). "Your nest? You have Eggs to look after?"


Subject Beta shook his head.


"Is it where your pack makes its nest?"


He shook his head, again.


"Then what's the problem? Why are you threatening me away from this place?"


Subject Beta didn't answer. At least, not in a way I could understand. There was a brief glance back, a shuffle of the haunches which might have been nervous, but that might just be my imagination playing games with me, after the fact.


Again, at the time, I was impatient. "Look," I said to the creature, "I'm not going into the compound, all right? I can't do what I came to do, thanks to you. I just want to get over this hill and..." I took a step forward. The Absol growled. I took a step back. "Look, Absol, we can be at this, all day. I know now you're not actually trying to hurt me, so you raising your hackles? I know that's a bluff. Put yourself in front of me, all you want, but you can't actually stop me from seeing the old buildings."


Now, to be clear (to myself, if and when I find myself reading this in the future), this was absolute empty bravado. Subject Beta's attempts to intimidate me were definitely working. Even if I was almost certain that Subject Beta was not out to hurt me (which I wasn't), that didn't mean that he still couldn't, whether by accident or because he eventually made the decision to turn to violence. If anyone was bluffing, it was me. But, I know that Pokemon can be reasoned with, just like people, and if there was any chance of me being able to do my job with my effects intact, in future, it was apparently going to require negotiation.


Subject Beta thought, for a moment. I could tell that he was thinking. The intelligence in those eyes eclipsed more than a few Researchers-in-training, that I had the unfortunate privilege of working with in college. The look on his face, as the gears turned in his head... honestly, it reminded me of a classmate I had in my sophomore year. Mack, I think his name was? The point is, I'd come to associate that face with rote calculations that the rest of us would just let the computers handle, but if he ever had to think about the logistics of detaining someone without assaulting them, I imagine he'd use the same face. Cute guy. Almost certain he was straight.


I am fucking stalling, right now. I'm gonna be rambling into this computer until the servers crash, at this rate.


I think I was going to say something, to Subject Beta. Take his silence as acknowledgment and try and force my way past him. Maybe that caused him to panic, or something, because the next thing I know, I've got a head in my gut and no air in my lungs. There was a bit of a struggle, as I tried to get to my feet. Within seconds, I found myself on my hands and knees, with the Absol pressing the full weight of his body down on top of mine. I squirmed. I pleaded. It was basically no time before my ruined pants were down around my knees, but in the confusion and fear of being attacked by a Pokemon, it was pretty easy to forget that.


Or at least, it was pretty easy to forget. It was easy to forget, until I felt a hindpaw clambering up my leg, taking my boxers with it on the return trip back down to the ground. Until I felt something warm and fuzzy nestle itself into the crack of my ass. Until I felt something significantly less fuzzy and significantly warmer press against my anus. Strong fore-paws wrapped around my stomach, as breath puffed against my ear in hot and heavy bursts. I craned my head, trying to look into Subject Beta's eyes, to try and get any sort of confirmation that things were going in the direction I thought they were about to. Subject Beta wouldn't meet my eyes, but the expression on his face was exactly the kind of self-conscious, virginal anticipation that made my heart simultaneously drop and race.


I couldn't see what Subject Beta had between his legs. Up until this point, I hadn't had a lot of reasons to learn the genital shape of any Pokemon that might have decided to do this kind of thing. I knew it was something in a sheath. I knew that, if the mounting pressure against my hole was any indication, what I was feeling was him slowly getting harder, with every shallow twitch of his hips. Everything I knew about his member, at that moment, I was learning by feel, and I was getting a lot of information, in a short span of time. He had a very tapered point, one that repeatedly sprayed hot, slick desperation right where it was needed. As he found purchase and started to enter me, he got thicker, but not by terribly much. I'd had toys that were more formidable than him. I would have had a man who was more formidable than him, at my last frat party, if said man didn't wind up cutting his losses and leaving when it turned out he had an incurable case of whiskey-dick.


Getting distracted, again. Fuck me, it just occurred to me that Subject Beta technically took my anal virginity from me. I don't remember if it doesn't count, if you used toys or whatever


THIS SYSTEM WILL ENTER SLEEP MODE IN ONE MINUTE


Okay. Fuck. I needed a second to ground myself. I'm good. I'm not good. I need to just get this out of my head and into writing, already.


At some point, in his lewd sawing back and forth, Subject Beta seemed to run out of cock to put in me. As I said, he wasn't particularly thick, but he was long. Also, I was out of practice. So, I was a little bit... transfixed at the sensation. If the fawning growls coming out of the Absol's mouth was any indication, he was feeling similarly transfixed. It was hard to tell whether he was paused, inside of me, because he wanted me to have a chance to get accustomed to him, or if he wanted to savor the sensation. His first proper thrusts were soft. Probing. Experimental. My body accepted him, without really thinking. I couldn't really think, was the problem. I still couldn't really believe what was happening to me. But then, his questing rod found... you know, the spot. The angle. It must have been something in the sound of my breath that gave it away, because once he knew he had found it, he adjusted his grip on my hips and started moving faster.


I find myself admitting, once again, that my body was quick to respond. In my defense, he was... almost perfect. When I say he panted in my ear like an animal, I mean that in the sense that he made the noises I would want a human to make, in my ear. His movements were fluid, they were controlled... but they were absolutely relentless. I felt the push against my prostate at least twice a second, felt the thighs against my cheeks, and... just, fuck, man. It was everything I expected was going to happen in my dorm room. If I closed my eyes, I could almost pretend I was there, so long as I ignored the Pokemon noises happening above me. Was he doing the same? Was Subject Beta closing his eyes, and pretending he was inside a fertile pussy? If he was, the very human noises I was making beneath him were doing nothing to slow him down.


By the time I remembered that I wasn't supposed to be enjoying this, it was far too late. Between the sensations and my own runaway imagination, I was a few thrusts away from going over the edge. I was already, no doubt, leaving a dark patch in the dirt, in the remains of my pants, and wherever else my cock was being swung to, by the force of Subject Beta's incessant rutting. If the blossoming warmth in my gut was any indication, the Absol wasn't much further behind. His soft cries were giving way to whimpers and whines, unabashedly announcing his pleasure to any passing creature who cared to listen.


It was around that time I felt something pressing against the ring of my anus. Something hot. Something larger than before. Subject Beta had been perfectly gentle, up until this point, but a mounting desperation began to very quickly erode at his patience. He tested my hole once, pulled back, then tested again. Each time he pushed, I thought I was going to feel the end of that girth, only to for him to retreat and come back to stretch me ever further. A million oaths struggled to spill out of me, as the realization hit me: he had a knot. I was being knotted.


Once it passed the halfway point, the only thing I remember was a blinding flash as he sunk the last inch or so inside me. The knot swelled and flared. Then, like a horrible serpent, Subject Beta began to writhe and spit in me. The Absol howled, his voice cracking. I don't remember making much noise, but I remember the mess, afterwards. By Mew, I must have left a half-gallon of my own genetic material in the dirt. My body was alive with pain and pleasure, as I was stretched open by a tunneling cock and its incessant flood of seed.


We stayed like that, for I don't know how long. Eventually, Subject Beta climbed off. Still joined to my ass, he lifted a leg over me and turned himself around. I could still feel him squirting into me. When I looked back, the expression on his panting face was fond. Fawning, almost. But, then he noticed I was looking at him, and bashfully he took an interest in the forest floor. I could feel the color in my cheeks, and knew I wasn't doing much better.


I remember that the first question I asked was not "why did you do this?" No, I believe the phrasing was more along the lines of "what the fuck just happened?" Subject Beta didn't answer. His flanks were still pulsating with his rapid breath as the torrent inside me died down to lazy squirts. My entire body trembled. I don't know if I would have been able to stand, even if I wasn't currently rooted to the spot. I felt a tugging, realized that Subject Beta was trying to lie down, and before I was really aware of it we were both on the ground. I had a better view between my legs, to the streaks of cum against the front of my pants. I tried to ignore it, to focus on other things.


See, I may not have known what Subject Beta was packing, but I knew enough about mating from my biology classes. The two of us were stuck together, the Absol locked in me, and he wasn't going to let me go until he was done flooding my rectum. I should have been disgusted at that, and I was. I am. But... sweet Mew save me, when I just let my mind wander a little bit, it was deceptively easy to forget all that and just bask in the intoxicating feel of afterglow. I found myself getting comfortable, on multiple occasions. Then, I'd remember that I was in an unsafe place, that my whistler was broken, that I was half-naked in the woods and that there was a Pokemon actively breeding me.


When I first saw the lights, I was in the middle of forgetting and afterglow basking. All of a sudden, a streak of bright yellow light shot into the sky. Lightning crashed down, shortly after, though there were no clouds anywhere in the sky. Bird Pokemon fled from the treetops in a cacophony of wing-beats and panicked tweets. The bushes rustled as a rush of air rolled over the hill and down over us, and then rustled further as any number of Pokemon fled. The air was split with the harsh, grating sound of a monstrous, bestial cry.


"What was that?" I asked, to no one in particular. Subject Beta didn't reply, but I felt his shaking where the two of us were joined. "That came from the compound. That... that was a Hyper Beam. And Thunder?"


Unbidden, I remembered something I had picked up, from who knows where. There's an urban legend that says that Absol will sense impending disaster, before it happens. I might have read a paper about it? I don't know, and it's not important. It was in my head, when I turned to look at the Absol. "You knew I was going there," I told it, "and you tried to stop me. You knew something bad was going to happen if I went, didn't you?"


Subject Beta yapped in the affirmative, only taking his nervous eyes off the skies ahead for a second, to meet my gaze.


"That's why you tried to scare me off, why you faked attacking me..." It was around that point that I remembered I still had his cock lodged in me. My face all but burst into flame, as the realization hit. "You... you were trying to restrain me, by..."


We exchanged awkward looks, at that. I didn't have the heart to finish the sentence, and Subject Beta could only offer a contrite whimper, even as another lazy squirt of seed filled my bowels. There were complicated emotions in those eyes, ones that no doubt were also in mine, as I struggled with how I was supposed to feel about today's events.


Unfortunately, the dangerous sounds ahead of us, which had thus far been a serviceable distraction from my complicated feelings, had died down as suddenly as they had started. Once he had drained himself, Subject Beta proved to be just as concerned for my comfort coming out, as he had when he first penetrated me. His tugs were slow, his eyes on my expression the whole time. I closed my eyes and tried to focus, using what little experience I had picked up from dark, lonely nights to relax, to let him escape. Even shrunk down, that knot was a cruel thing. I felt the briefest flash of pain, before something warm and potent-smelling was pouring down the side of my ass-cheek. Subject Beta immediately backed away, sitting down and licking at his retreating member. I, meanwhile, struggled to all fours, before drunkenly getting up on my feet.


I pulled my pants back up over myself. They were going to soak through, with all the stuff that was leaking out of me, but at least this way I wouldn't be able to look back and see a trail. I was pulled from those thoughts when Subject Beta bumped his head against my hand, making contented noises as he ran my fingers through the fur on his head. I looked from him, to the road leading to the compound. "I can't stay here," I said. "You should probably leave, too." Subject Beta made a few noises, something like protest. I shrugged at him and said "Look, you win. I'm not going to the compound, anymore. You can stop guarding the road, or whatever you've been doing.


Subject Beta huffed. Opening his mouth, he closed his jaws over my hand. I yelped, before I realized he wasn't putting pressure down on his bite. Instead, he pulled my arm as he walked down the road, back in the direction of home. "You... are going with me?" I tried to translate. The Absol whined around my hand, pulling me a half-step down the road. I know I probably shouldn't have accepted, but... the whistler was broken, the Repel was being masked by smells best left unmentioned, and for multiple reasons I wasn't quite able to move as well as I would have liked. And so, despite myself, I was happy for the bodyguard.


The walk home was surprisingly uneventful. Subject Beta stayed close, taking frequent pauses from his vigilance of the woods around us to give me a happy cry or a reassuring nuzzle. If I didn't know any better, I would have thought he had grown fond of me, or something. As we were approaching the path up the mountain, towards my little cavern, there was a Mightyena laying in the middle of the road.


Subject Alpha.


I felt a twinge of panic, as she got to her feet. She looked from the Absol, to me. Her nostrils flared. I knew she could smell what had happened. For a moment, I thought she was going to attack, either me or Subject Beta. Instead, she stood off to the side. I paused, a moment, before slowly walking past her. I looked into those dark red, intelligent eyes.


She licked her chops at me, as I passed.
