[Forest trail. Night time. Heavy cloud cover. The only recognized light source is an electric lantern, held in front of the camera. Left hand holding lantern recognized as belonging to Root User. User's gaze pans left and right, slowly, as they walk forward.]


[Voice (M): I'm not picking anything up, Beta. It's...]


[Unknown Wild Pokemon: Sol?]


Voice positively identified as belonging to Root User. Wild Pokemon's vocalization consistent with PND #359: Absol.


[User: Oh. Um... Sorry.] [Camera pans right and down. A Pokemon is visible, walking alongside User.] [User: I've been calling you Subject Beta in my notes. Just to... you know, to differentiate...]


Creature identified as Absol (PND Entry 359). Physical markers consistent with Absol previously marked by Scanner.


[Wild Absol makes eye contact with User, appears thoughtful. Then, it barks. Body language analysis: Pokemon appears to be happy (Confidence Index: 84%)]


[User: What are you...? No. No, you're not... It's not a nickname. I didn't give you a nickname, Be... Absol. That's something trainers do. No, no, I just put you down as Subject Beta in reports so you wouldn't be confused with any other Absol I talk about. It's... it's just a standard Lab thing.]


[Camera pans suddenly left, back towards the forest trail. The trail opens up into a clearing, approximately twenty meters ahead.]


[User: Anyway, like I was saying... it's been real quiet. I haven't gotten a hit on my goggles, and I don't think you've had to pull us aside once, since you found me.] [A pause. User slows down, for a second.] [User: So... it's safe. It's completely safe. You don't...]


[Wild Absol stops walking, turns to look at User.]


[User: I just don't think you have to follow me, is all. I don't even know how you managed to find me, because it's obvious I'm not going anywhere dangerous. You should just head back to your nest, and...]


[Wild Absol: Ab!] [Wild Absol lunges forward and bites at User's right hand. No move detected. Bite force too weak to do damage. Body language analysis: Pokemon appears to be chastising User, as a parent Pokemon does to a juvenile (Confidence Index: 72%)]


[User: Wh... hey! Beta, stop! Cut it out!] [Wild Absol opens his mouth. User withdraws his hand, shakes it, wipes it on his shirt.] [User: Mew, all right, all right. Message received. You're not gonna stop following me, even if I tell you otherwise, huh?]


[Wild Absol: Sol.] [Wild Absol nods, before turning to continue down the path.]


[User tracks Wild Absol's movements with his eyes, as Absol walks into the clearing ahead. User speaks quietly.] [User: It's fine. It's fine, Theo. What's one more creature present, while I'm being blackmailed? It's not like he could report me to the League. Or that he'd want to. At least I have a f...] [Camera tilts right, slightly.] [User: What... is he doing?]


[User advances towards the clearing. Wild Absol stares into the darkness. Wild Absol's muscles are tensed, hackles raised. Body language analysis: Pokemon is ready for combat.]


[User: What's up? Is there something... out...] [User looks ahead. Moonlight begins to peek through the clouds, increasing ambient light. Environment appears to be an artificial clearing. Tree stumps visible on the outskirts, grass and shrubbery around consistent with recent growth. Markings are barely visible in the grass, consistent with the arrangement of a League standard Pokemon battle pitch. A Pokemon is visible, on the far side of the pitch, sitting in one of the trainer boxes.]


Analyzing:


*Quadruped

*Canid body type

*Pink and white fur coloration, with blue highlights

*Bow and ribbons around throat and base of left ear


Creature identified as Sylveon (PND Entry 700). OT data detected. Pokemon Nickname: [REDACTED]. Trainer: [REDACTED].


[User: No way. What's a Sylveon doing all the way out here? Those almost never happen natur... wait... I see trainer data. Or... not. This is a trainer's Pokemon?]


[Voice (F): Not anymore, but that's a long story.]


ERROR. Analysis indicates that unknown female voice originates from Sylveon. Confirming...


[Wild Absol: Sol?!]


[User: It can talk?!]


[Voice (F): *giggles* Of course 'it' can talk, silly. Pokemon talk all the time.]


Confidence Index exceeds 70% threshold: Unknown female voice belongs to Sylveon [REDACTED].


[Wild Absol rushes forward, facing Sylveon. Wild Absol growls and assumes a combat stance.]


[Sylveon: Oh... oh, sweetie, no. That's not going to end well for you, at all.]


[Wild Absol looks back to user, barks urgently.]


[User: What? What are you...?]


[Sylveon: Ignore him, human. Absol over here doesn't like me very much. His little danger sense doesn't work on me, so he thinks I'm some kind of threat.] [Sylveon begins to glow a faint pink. Move Detected: Disarming Voice] [Sylveon: But I'm not threatening at all, am I, little puppy?]


[Wild Absol sways on his feet. It's super effective!]


[Camera drifts off-focus] [User: What... was that? Was that a move?]


[Sylveon continues to glow. A slight echo is audible in her voice.] [Sylveon: No, of course not. Don't be ridiculous. Do I look like I'm about to attack you guys?]


[Wild Absol shakes his head, whining in distress.]


[Slyveon: Aww. Looks like the little puppy is up past his bedtime. That's okay, Absol. I was hoping to talk to your boyfriend alone, anyway. Why don't you run along and get caught up on your beauty sleep? I promise to return him to you... more or less intact.]


[Wild Absol looks back to User. Signs of distress and fear are apparent. Suddenly, Wild Absol turns and dashes off into the trees to User's right.]


[User: Wait! Beta! Where are you going?] [Camera moves slightly, in pursuit of fleeing Wild Absol.]


[Sylveon: I told you to forget about him, human.]


[Camera pans back towards Sylveon. Sylveon has ceased performing the Disarming Voice move. Sylveon begins to walk forward, taking careful, deliberate steps in a manner consistent with Contest performers.]


[Sylveon: You've got something far more important to deal with, right now. Namely, me.]


[User: You... you were the one who talked to me in the woods, this morning?]


[Sylveon: You catch on quick. Must be all that Lab training you've got, making you so smart.] [Sylveon brushes against user's leg. The ribbon-like appendages on its shoulders begin to wrap around User's leg, as it walks a circuit around him.] [Sylveon: I'm what you might call the queen of this little valley. Or at least, all the parts of the valley you've been screwing around in. There's not a lot that escapes my attention. Especially news that another human has come around here, and that he's already balls-deep in the natives.]


[User follows Sylveon with motions of his head. His hands are visible, shaking in distress.] [User: No, that's... I-I'm not... I'm not a...]


[Sylveon looks up at User with a grin.] [Sylveon: Oh, how cute. You think you can dodge the Pokefucker allegation by acting like a virgin about it.]


[User: What? That's... I'm... huh?!]


[Sylveon: Oh, relax. I already told you, I have no intention of telling any of your bosses. Not that they'd believe little old me, if I told them.]


[User takes a step backwards, meets Slyveon's eyes.] [User: Then... what? W-why did you call me all the way out here?]


[Sylveon: Because I needed something other than blackmail, to get you to stay put. Look around you.][Sylveon motions to the surrounding woods with her right-hand ribbon tendril. Camera pans around as Sylveon speaks.][Sylveon: It's just you and me out on this pitch, human, and I've made sure it's gonna stay that way. But you're a long way away from your little cave. Once you get back on the road, there's really no telling what you might run into, this late at night. Something predatory, no doubt, and knowing your luck they're gonna be more interested in eating you, than fucking you.]


[Camera begins to pan around, more aggressively, before User looks down at his belt. User's free hand touches his Whistler Pokemon deterrent device.]


[Sylveon: Oh, relax, you little drama magnet. I'm not about to leave you out to dry.] [Sylveon grins, fangs glinting in the light.][Sylveon: You be a good little boy, and I'll be sure you get back to your bed, unharmed. You'll probably even be happier than when you left, from what I've seen of you.]


[User: Um... right. Okay...][User lets go of his Whistler, looks at Sylveon][User: So... what do you need me t-]


[Sylveon: Strip.]


[Silence for approximately thirty seconds. A cry from a distant tree can be heard, consistent with the Pokemon Hoothoot (PND Entry 163).]


[User: I'm sorry... what?]


[Sylveon: You heard me. Get every stitch of those stupid clothes off. I want to get a good look at what I have to...] [Sylveon pauses to lick its chops] [Sylveon: ...work with.]


[Silence for approximately thirty-five seconds. User shifts his weight, back and forth. Then, User puts down his lantern. Looking down, he begins to unbutton his shirt. A rustle of fabric, as User shucks off his shirt. The camera is momentarily blocked, as User's undershirt is pulled up and over his head. User removes the Whistler from the clip on his belt, slowly placing it on top of the pile with his shirt and undershirt. User unlaces his boots, putting them aside. He undoes his belt, opening it and the fly of his jeans. Finally, he pulls them down, along with his boxers, carefully stepping out onto the grass.]


[User covers his gentials with both hands, before looking to Sylveon.] [User: Th-there. That's good, right?]


[Sylveon appears thoughtful, rubbing the bottom of its chin with one of its tendrils.] [Sylveon: Hmmm... it's a start. I gotta say, I wasn't expecting you to be so... skinny, underneath all those clothes. Usually, I like my men to have some meat on them, but... never mind. Consider yourself lucky that you don't have a lot of competition.]


[Sylveon begins to circle around User. Camera pans to follow it. Body language analysis: inconclusive. Pokemon appears to be: hungry, angry, aroused. Further analysis required.]


[Sylveon: You gonna keep those goggles on?]


[User: Um... well, I...]


[Sylveon: Oh, it's fine. I kind of like it. Makes you look like a Flygon.] [Sylveon completes a circuit around User, before staring at User's hands.] [Sylveon: I need a better angle. Get on the ground.]


[User: What?]


[Sylveon: On the ground. Hands and knees.] [A pause of several seconds. Sylveon makes an impatient chuff.] [Sylveon: You can either do it yourself, or I can force you down here. Up to you, champ.]


[User can be heard letting out a shuddering breath. Camera begins to pan downwards, in an uneven motion. User is now kneeling on the grass.]


[Sylveon: Hands and knees, human. That means you're gonna have to stop touching yourself.]


[Another unsteady breath. Camera moves forward, points down to the ground. User's hands can be seen on the grass.]


[Sylveon: That's better.][Sylveon resumes circling around User] [Sylveon: You have no idea how long it's been since I've had one of you humans, like this. Oh...] [Sylveon makes a noise consistent with Sylveon mating cries.] [Sylveon: ... Hello there, sweetie. Princess missed you.]


[User: Who are...? Wh-what are you planning on doing?]


[Sylveon: Oh, I think you know.] [Camera jerks violently. A human gasp is audible.] [Sylveon: And if this bad boy is any indication, you're already raring to go.]


[Voice (F): N-no! Fuck, don't touch there!]


Scanning... Unidentified female voice analyzed, believed to belong to Root User. Confidence Index: 60%. Currently not at threshold to identify positively.


[Sylveon: It's okay. You don't have to play dumb, anymore. It's just you and me, right now.]


[Voice (F): Fuck... I...]


[Camera pans down and around. View is now an upside-down angle of User's chest, stomach and legs. User is fully erect. Sylveon's ribbon tendrils are wrapped around User's genitals. One tendril slides up and down the length of his shaft, while the other wraps around his testicles.]


[Sylveon: Nnnngh, I fucking love these things. My dragons back home are nice, but they can't beat the perfect shape of a good, hard human cock. And yours is just the right size, too. Not too big, but just...the right... amount...of heft.][Sylveon punctuates each pause with a full stroke of User's penis, from base to glans and back again.]


[Camera pans back up, looking up towards the sky. User can be heard panting.]


[Sylveon: Oh! Looks like someone's getting twitchy. Are you gonna cum, big boy? Are you gonna cum from a little Sylveon's ribbons?]


[Voice (F): I... yes! Please, fuck, don't... I'm gonna...!]


[Camera shakes suddenly. A sharp smack can be heard. Unknown female voice yelps in pain. Camera turns left. A red welt is visible on User's left glute. User looks Sylveon in the eye.]


Body language analysis: inconclusive. Sylveon appears to be: angry, aroused, hungry. Further analysis required.


[Sylveon: I wasn't talking to you, human. I was talking to your cock.]


[User: Uh... I'm... sorry?]


[Sylveon huffs.] [Sylveon: Well, now you've killed the mood.] [Sylveon walks up along the left side of User's body, ribbon-tendril sliding along his flank as they do so.] [Sylveon: Whatever. I was getting bored of the foreplay, anyway. Maybe we ought to give that big mouth of yours something to do.]


[User: What do you... oh...]


[Camera angle focused on Sylveon's hindquarters. Sylveon positively identified as female. Clear signs of sexual arousal detected: swollen labia, active vaginal secretions, pink-red coloration from inflamed, elevated temperature skin. Analysis: Sylveon appears to be in her luteal period.]


[User: Oh, Mew. You're in heat, aren't you?]


[Sylveon: Of course you'd be able to tell that, just by looking.] [Sylveon looks back at User, grinning as she shakes her hindquarters side to side.] [Sylveon: Since you're such a clever human, I bet you already know what I'm going to ask you to do about it.]


[Silence for several seconds. The camera angles downward, for a second, and then back up. Sylveon's smile gets wider.]


[Sylveon: Ooh! Aren't you a gentleman? Well, if you're going to just open your mouth like that...] [Sylveon backs up, until her hindquarters are in extreme closeup.] [Sylveon: Go on. Get your tongue in there.]


[For the next few minutes, very little is visible other than pink and white fur, with occasional glimpses of the woods beyond at the fringes of the shot. User can be heard breathing heavily, with something obstructing his mouth. Sylveon makes noises consistent with mating cries, punctuated by snippets of human speech.]


[Sylveon: Fuuuuck! I forgot how fucking good humans are with their tongues. Oh, do you have any idea... *cries* how hard it is trying to get a Pokemon's snout to hit the same places? You might as well try to peel an apple with a *cries, moans*... Oh, fuck it, just don't stop!]


[User's breath appears to get heavier. Muffled moans can be heard. Suddenly, the camera and the fur obscuring its view begins to shake violently. Sylveon makes a long, sonorous cry. She can then be heard panting heavily, alongside User. Camera pulls back. Once again in view is Sylveon's genitals, now with matted fur and significantly more fluid. A thin stream of fluid can be seen glinting, connecting Sylveon's labia to something just slightly off-screen downward, before it breaks. As the camera angles up and away, it can be seen that Sylveon is half-laying down, face and chest against the dirt and hindquarters up as high as she can manage. Her expression seems to be one of pleasure or delirium.]


[Sylveon: Fuck... okay, I admit it. That wasn't halfway bad.]


[User: Is... that good, then? You've got what you needed, and...]


[Sylveon lifts her head off the ground.] [Sylveon: What? You wanna pack it in, already? Looks like your friend between your legs has other ideas.]


[Camera turns to look down at User's body. User is visibly aroused. Precum leaks from his penis.]


[Sylveon: Come on, human.] [Camera turns back around. Sylveon once again begins to shake her hips back and forth. A pink aura begins to suffuse from her body. Move detected: Disarming Voice.] [Sylveon: Don't you wanna bury that bone somewhere hot and tight?]


[Camera lurches, to one side.] [User: What... there it is again... what are you doing to me?]


[Disarming Voice continues.] [Sylveon: I'm not doing anything, human. I'm just a poor, defenseless, fertile Pokemon who needs someone to make this mean old heat go away. Won't you have a heart?]


[Camera appears to follow Sylveon's hindquarters, as it shakes back and forth.][User: Ffffffuuuuck...] [A drop of vaginal secretions falls to the grass. User's eyes track it as it falls.]


[A sudden burst of movement. Camera view unclear for several seconds. User appears to shuffle forward. When camera stabilizes, Sylveon is beneath User. The two of them make frantic movements, for several seconds.]


[Voice (F): Ohhhhh!]


[Sylveon makes noises consistent with mating cries.]


[For several minutes, camera rocks back and forth. User alternates between staring up at the moon, and down at Sylveon. Sylveon continues to stand with her front half on the ground, and her hindquarters raised. When the camera first pans down, her mouth is open, and her eyes are unfocused and shimmering. At the extreme bottom of the shot, mostly out of frame, User's genitals can be seen pressed against Sylveon's hindquarters.]


Anomalous behavior detected. Analyzing... User and Pokemon appear to be engaging in mating behaviors.


[Voice (F): Fuck... fuck! Oh, sweet Mew, I...]


[Sylveon: *chuckles* Nngh, you like that? You like the feeling of your Princess's tight snatch?]


[Voice (F): Mm-hmm! It's... ah! So... good!]


[Sylveon makes several mating cries, before dipping back into human speech.] [Sylveon: Tell me you love me.]


[Voice (F): Ah! Ah! Wh-what?]


[Sylveon begins to glow pink. Move detected: Disarming Voice.] [Sylveon: Tell me you love me. Tell me how much you love your Princess.]


[Unknown female voice breathes heavily.] [Voice (F): I... I love you, Sylveon.]


[Sylveon: Call... me... Princess!]


[Voice (F): P-Princess! I love you, Princess!]


[Sylveon: Fuck! Masterrrrrrrrr...!]


[Camera begins to jerk violently. Noises from both Sylveon and unknown female consistent with the sounds of orgasm. User slumps over, after a moment. In frame is Sylveon, whose head is on its side in the grass. Her mouth is wide open, tongue lolling out, ribbon-tendrils shivering as her body jerks and spasms. Eventually, user pulls back, falling to a seated position. Sylveon's vulva is visible, now leaking semen. The ground between Sylveon and User is wet, along with the inside of both User and Sylveon's thighs. Eventually, Sylveon falls to her side, fixing User with a stare and a smile as her chest rises and falls.]


[Sylveon: Fuck me, I forgot how good humans were.]


[User pants heavily.]


[Sylveon: Well, now... this is awkward.] [Sylveon stumbles, as she gets back on her paws.] [Sylveon: I was gonna just let you go, at this point, but to be honest... I kinda like you.]


[User: Huh... huh? What?]


[Sylveon turns around, walking towards User. Semen drips from her as she approaches.] [Sylveon: Yeah, sorry, but after a dicking like that, I can't exactly let you just go back to your cave. You're coming with me, now. I've got a little place in the central compound, and it's got a doggy bed with your name on it.]


[User: W-wait a second. You promised I...]


[Sylveon: Well, I changed my mind. Besides...] [Sylveon begins to glow. Move detected: Disarming Voice.] [Sylveon: ...you'd be so much happier, with me, than you would working for that stupid old Lab.]


[User: I... that's...]


[Sylveon's Disarming Voice intensifies.] [Sylveon: We've got food and shelter, and you'll want for nothing. Nothing you won't happily give up, anyway. I can show you to my boyfriend.]


[User: B-boyfriend?]


[Sylveon: He's a Dragonite.]


[User: D-D-Dragonite?!]


[Sylveon: Yup. A big, strong... horny ...dragon. He's fun, but he can be a handful to take care of. Luckily, I'll have you to help keep him happy.]


[User begins breathing heavily. At the edge of frame, his penis can be seen. The beginnings of an erection are evident.]


[Sylveon's Disarming Voice continues.] [Sylveon: Plus, you'd get to fuck me. Every. Single. Night.] [Sylveon giggles, standing on User's thigh and rubbing her cheek against his chest.] [Sylveon: Don't lie to yourself, human. You really think you can go home to that ratty old Mightyena, after you've had a taste of me?]


[Sylveon's ribbons begin to wrap around User's arms. User's chest begins to rise and fall, as his breathing gets more shallow and strained.]


[User: N-no... wait, I... please, no. I can't, I...] [Camera turns, looking off into the woods.] [User: Please... help... somebody...]


[A rustling in the bushes. A loud Pokemon cry can be heard. Move detected: Howl. A black shape bursts out of the brush, into the clearing. It sails across the field at speed, before launching in the direction of User.]


Warning: Move detected: Crunch.


[User: What th-oh, sweet MEW!]


[Black shape collides with Sylveon, jaws clamping down on her flank as they're both thrown away. Sylveon's ribbons relinquish their hold on User, as she tumbles away. Black shape throws Sylveon aside.]


Creature identified as Mightyena (PND Entry 262). Physical markers consistent with Mightyena previously marked by Scanner.


[Sylveon stands. The attack was not very effective!] [Sylveon: Oh! Well, speak of the bitch, and she appears.]


[Mightyena growls. Expression and body language unambiguously denote anger.]


[Sylveon laughs, with dramatic exaggeration. One ribbon tendril hovers near her mouth, like a human hand.] [Sylveon: I'm afraid you're already too late. Your boy's already told me he loves me. Actually, it was too late when he was slobbering on that Absol's cock, but...]


[Mightyena rushes forward. Move detected: Crunch.]


[Sylveon dodges out of the way.] [Sylveon: Testy, aren't we?] [Stars begin to manifest around Sylveon, launching out from her towards Mightyena. Move detected: Swift.]


[Mightyena dashes through the attack, snarling as they slam against her body. She dives forward. Move detected: Take Down. The two Pokemon collide, rolling over one another as they tussle in the grass. The maneuver ends with Mightyena standing on top of Sylveon, preparing the move Crunch.]


[Sylveon pulls her head up and presses her snout to Sylveon's. Mightyena stiffens. Then, she staggers, as Sylveon rises to her paws. Move detected: Draining Kiss. Mightyena falls to the ground. It's super effective!]


[User: Alpha!]


[Sylveon: Please. I got more of a workout from the human than from you.] [Sylveon walks towards User, head held high and a look of derision on her face.] [Sylveon: Well, now that that's out of the way... human. What do you say you and I...?]


[Mightyena growls. She tries to stand up, but fails.]


[Sylveon looks back.] [Sylveon: Are you still moving around, back there? Look, I get it. I'd be pissed off too if someone prettier than me decided to turn me into a cuckquean. But it's over. You lost. It wasn't ever gonna go any other way, and you know it. If you know what's good for you, you'll stay down.]


[Mightyena tries to stand, again. She manages to do it, with difficulty. She opens her mouth and makes an incredibly loud cry, her face clearly exhibiting signs of rage. Move detected: Roar.]


[Sylveon appears unimpressed.] [Sylveon: Ugh, what a pain in the ass. All right. If you won't stay down, then I'm just gonna have to make you stay down.] [Sylveon begins to glow with a pale white light, ribbons and fur lifting upward from an unseen force. Move detected: Moonblast.] [Sylveon: Have fun pulling yourself out of a coma, bitch!]


[Mightyena snarls, defiantly. She squares her stance, staying well in the projected path of the coming projectile.]


[User: No... Alpha...] [User can be heard breathing heavily. Audio signals consistent with stress reactions become more and more pronounced, over the next few seconds.]


[Sudden movement. The sound of footfalls on dirt, disturbed grass. The camera sways and jerks in a manner consistent with rapid movement. When the view settles, angle is now head-on with Sylveon. Sylveon has ceased charging her Moonblast, her expression one of confusion. Camera quickly looks back. Mightyena is in frame now, her expression one of confusion.]


[Sylveon: What are you doing, human?]


[User: I... I don't... p-please stop this. Don't hurt her, anymore.]


[Sylveon recoils, as if struck (no move detected).] [Sylveon: Are... are you fucking serious?! You'd put yourself in the way of a fucking Moonblast for that thing? She's a Mightyena! A failed matriarch who only keeps you around because she can treat you like her little relief whore!]


[User: I don't care. Do whatever you want to me, just... let her go.]


[Mightyena can be heard behind the camera, making soft vocalizations. All signs of aggression have abated.]


[Body language analysis: Sylveon appears hurt. Her expression falls over the course of several seconds. For a brief moment, a glimmer of a tear can be seen from the corner of her eye. Then, Sylveon's expression changes. Muscles tighten, as she bears her fangs and snarls. She begins to glow again, with pale white light.]


WARNING! Incoming move: Moonblast. Evade immediately!


[Sylveon: Fine! Since you clearly love her so goddamn much, you can just join her in the fucking dirt!]


Evade! Evade! Evade!


[User turns off the Scanner's predictive move warning system at this point.]


[Mightyena makes a chuckling vocalization, as she lurches forward in spite of her pain. She attempts to put herself in the path of the oncoming Moonblast.]


[Sylveon flinches, as a white shape bounds in from right of frame. Canceling her attack, she hops out of the way as a dark purple streak of energy scores a hole in the dirt, where she had stood. Move detected: Night Slash.]


[User: Beta?]


[Absol takes a combat stance, in front of the hole made by his attack.]


[Sylveon: You again? You know, considering I just got done beating up a Dark type, you running out to fight me by yourself seems like a really dumb idea.]


[Absol makes several chattering vocalizations.]


[Sylveon's expression falls. An orange glow begins to emanate from behind camera left.] [Sylveon: What do you mean, you didn't come al...?]


[Sylveon dives out of the way. A giant glyph of pure fire screams past the camera and downfield, leaving twin trails of burning grass as it goes. Move detected: Fire Blast. Camera turns around. Multiple Pokemon burst from the bushes, running into the field.]


Species detected:

Arcanine

Houndour

Growlithe

Vulpix

Vulpix (2)


No OT data detected on any.


[Houndour, Growlithe, and the two Vulpixes form a line in front of Arcanine, and all begin to fire off attacks, one after the other. Growlithe uses Ember! Houndour uses Ember! Vulpix uses Ember! Vulpix (2) uses Ember! The camera feed turns to follow the spray of projectiles, as they fly downrange at Sylveon. The embers scatter widely, falling to the grass and creating hundreds of potential flash-points.]


[Sylveon attempts to escape to the extreme far range of the attacks, but is unable to do so before bits of flaming material land on her. She lets out a cry consistent with damage, dashing to the far edge of the pitch and rolling in the dirt to extinguish herself.]


[Camera turns back to look in the direction of the five new Pokemon. Houndour, Growlithe and the two Vulpixes growl, all assuming a combat stance. Arcanine stands, glaring in Sylveon's direction.]


[Camera returns to Sylveon, who pulls herself to her feet. Her fur is matted and singed, and her expression is unambiguously livid.] [Sylveon: Fucking bullshit! How's an entire kennel of mutts going to get past my lookouts, huh?]


[Camera looks over to Mightyena, quickly. Then, it looks back at the five canines. Arcanine makes eye contact with user. Its tail wags, briefly. Then, it resumes glaring down at Sylveon.]


[Sylveon: Fine.] [Camera turns back to Sylveon, who is lightly obscured behind a trail of smoke coming from a nearby patch of grass.] [Sylveon: I know better than to try and pick a fight with five mutts at once. I've already got what I wanted. You guys can fight over who gets sloppy seconds.] [Sylveon makes eye contact with User.] [Sylveon: You and I aren't done with each other, human. You'll get tired of being the valley's resident whore. Look me up, when you do. I can promise you'll be so much happier, as my pet.] [Sylveon turns around and dashes into the bushes, where she quickly disappears from view.]


[User: That... I think... we're okay?] [Camera turns to look at Mightyena. Mightyena lurches forward, licking at User's face.] [User: Ack! Alpha! What... ugh, hold on, it's... you're getting your tongue in m... mmmph!]


[Camera angles away, though the sound of heavy breathing and licking is still audible. Houndour stands tall, barking in the direction that Sylveon escaped from. Growlithe bounces around, tail wagging. The two Vulpixes yip excitedly, play-fighting with each other. They all stop what they're doing, however, when Arcanine barks, turning to face it. Arcanine motions with its head, at the field. Off-screen, the smoke is getting slowly thicker. The other canines appear bashful, but they quickly scatter off onto the pitch. There, they appear to begin stamping out fires.]


[User crawls backwards, a short distance. Mightyena stops licking at User's face. Absol can be seen, approaching from camera right.]


[User: Beta... Alpha... you guys... what are you...?]


[Absol bumps his head against User's shoulder. He lets out a cry, that appears to sound mournful.]


[User: Oh... oh, no, Beta, it's all right.] [User reaches a hand up, runs it through the fur on Absol's neck.] [User: You went to go try and find help, didn't you? That's why Alpha and the others are here, right?] [User's other hand reaches out to stroke Mightyena.] [User: You guys... came to save me. You really...] [User's voice begins to break.] [User:...you really... risked yourselves to save... you guys... fuck!]


[The camera suddenly begins moving violently. User's hand can be seen for a brief moment, before the camera is sent flying. Camera lands in the grass. Angle vaguely captures User, Mightyena and Absol, halfway visible on camera left. User has both Pokemon in an embrace, arms wrapped around their necks. Audio indicates that User is crying, but that is not visible because Absol's body partly obscures User, and User appears to have his face buried in Mightyena's fur. Mightyena and Absol exchange glances, over User's head. Absol begins to nuzzle the back of User's head. Mightyena licks at User's shoulder.]


[Growlithe can be seen entering on camera right, burned tatters of a pair of denim jeans in its mouth.]

OPENING DRAFT...


Sweet fucking mew yes get me the fuck out of this valley righ


>_


Good morning, Professor,


Thank you for the opportunity to think over the extension to my tour of duty. I will be honest, it was a difficult decision, and I very much needed the time to consider. The work out here has been difficult, though you would know that better than most. The physical needs of the job certainly took some getting used to. I am glad to hear that my reports have been adequate, for that was something that I genuinely worried about.


I believe that you may have been right in your assessment that I have an affinity for this style of field work. The truth is, for all its faults, I rather enjoy the assignment. The valley will make an exemplary reserve, one day, and it's already got more than its share of unique and interesting Pokemon. I would be honored if you'd allow me to stay out here, a while longer.


Let me know whenever it becomes necessary how my job might change, as the temperatures get warmer. I am already excited to see how the migration patterns will affect the makeup of Pokemon in the region.


Sincerely,


Junior Researcher Larch.
